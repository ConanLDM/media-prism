# README

This application is media based, focusing on currently music,movies, video games and TV shows. There is room to extend to other forms of media.

Looking to implement some form of media player in the application, at least for
making music playable.

Intend to utilise Turbo Morphing for part of the media element, as it has been used in other cases previously for a media player.

May look to make use of external JS frameworks (e.g. React, Vue). Also will make use of at least one of Bootstrap or Tailwind.


## Current progress

Have setup models for genrs, movies, video games and TV shows. several base controllers for these models have been setup.
